# Cofound â€“ The Fullstack Framework that's Just Code

Cofound is a modern, opinionated TypeScript web framework for Sin. Its main goal is to keep your code as maintainable as possible, while being trivially scalable for medium-scale apps, which cover nearly all applications on the web.

Cofound provides built-in support for:

- Pre (static sites) and server-side rendering
- Session & Passkey auth
- SQLite query models and schema management
- Simple RPCs for frontend-backend interactions

## Quick Start

You can cofound a new project using the `cofound-create` command:

```bash
npx cofound-create myapp
```
